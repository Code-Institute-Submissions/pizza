# Jordan's Pizza | Responsive Pizza Restaurant Website

This is a ‘digital invite’ I have developed for my brother and his fiance who are getting married in 2019. It is a front-end website that provides visitors with:
1.	Pizza Menu with toppings details, prices, pictures and a modal window for Order options
2.	Contact details including an embedded google map, opening hours, address and phone number
3.	Information about the history and cooking tradition of the Pizza Restaurant
4.	A contact form

## Demo

A demo of this site is available [here](https://jordandaly.github.io/ucfd/index.html).

This website is hosted by Github Pages, a static site hosting service which supports client-side code. It does not support server-side functionality.


## Getting started / Deployment

* If you wish to run this site locally, please clone or download this repo. You can then run index.html or open index.html in your browser.
* If you wish to deploy a live version of this site, then you will need to create your own Github repo. Navigate to settings and enable Github Pages by setting the Source to master branch. 
 

## Built With

**HTML, CSS and JavaScript:** Front end languages that give the application structure, style and interactivity

## UX Design

Details of the UX design and research process undertaken as part of this project is available in the 
projectdocumentation folder. This document outlines how I approached the design of this site and includes 
my ideas for further development of this site (beyond the scope of this site as a static website project).

## Testing

Manual testing was undertaken for this application and satisfactorily passed. A sample of the tests conducted are as follows:
1.	Testing the responsiveness of the application (on desktop and mobile applications)
2.	Testing the code to call the google API
3.	Testing buttons and hyperlinks throughout the site
